# Risk Assessment for Value at Risk Using Copula-Based Modeling

This repository presents a comparative risk assessment framework using **traditional and copula-based methods** to estimate **Value at Risk (VaR)** for **Indian and U.S. equity portfolios** at a 1% confidence level.

---

## 📌 Overview

- **Objective**: Quantify and compare downside market risk for Indian and U.S. equities under different VaR modeling frameworks.
- **Key Insight**: U.S. equities showed, on average, ~41% higher VaR than Indian equities under copula-based models, highlighting greater downside risk in turbulent conditions.

## ⚒️ Methodologies Implemented

- **Traditional VaR Models**:
  - Historical Simulation
  - Parametric (Variance-Covariance)
  - Monte Carlo Simulation

- **Advanced Modeling**:
  - Copula-Based VaR (Gaussian, t, Clayton, Gumbel, Frank)
  - Marginal Distribution Fitting (Normal, t)
